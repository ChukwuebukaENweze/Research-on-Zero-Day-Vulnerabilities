Zero Day vulnerability in college
    In the world today with different computer systems, more different upgrades are being
released everyday. Zero day attacks have increased as well. This research paper dives into how to
tackle zero day attacks. The first document by (Zoppi et al., 2021) explains how you can
recognize the risk. It shows different types of unsupervised techniques that can be used to detect
these attacks, also it investigates the performance of different software out that its job is to detect
zero day attacks. The second research paper (Roumani, Y., 2021) and it focuses on patches that
are sometimes released by software companies to fix vulnerabilities, it analyzes their timing
using the spanning of patches released over decades. It reveals the factors behind timely patches,
hereby providing cybersecurity strategies. Lastly (Barros et al., 2022) this paper presents a
learning approach called Malware-SMELL, this learning approach was developed to identify
zero day vulnerabilities in malware, this approach utilizes neural networks and similarities
between data points, this enhances the difference between antivirus software methods.

       The research conducted was done to investigate the use of unsupervised algorithms for
detecting zero day, and these attacks are unknown and hereby uncharacterized threats. It
shows us the full difference between rule based and supervised machine algorithms in
detecting attacks and it gives us examples of unsupervised detection algorithms.
The paper also dives into the use of meta-learning, which is when the machines'
algorithms have been trained to detect zero day attacks, and also easy it is to train them to
detect new attacks. It presents an applied approach for comparing unsupervised
algorithms and shows their effectiveness in detecting zero day attacks using an already
existing algorithm for dataset. In conclusion, this document talks about the importance of
choosing the right approach to detect zero day attacks, and provides important new
knowledge to cybersecurity experts or non-experts alike.

    This paper dives into the patch release time by companies to fight zero day
vulnerabilities and it examines the factor that affects it. It used a dataset between 2010
and 2020 that lays out zero-day vulnerabilities captured between that time and it analyzes
the impact of various vulnerability- related factors on patch release timing. The study
shows high risk attacks and its impact on more vendors, software products are more
likely to be patched right away while vulnerabilities that are more likely to invade our
privacy and impact confidentiality are never patched on time.

Malware-SMELL: A zero-shot learning strategy for detecting zero-day vulnerabilities.

    The document discusses a new learning strategy called Malware-SMELL which is used
in detecting zero day attacks and vulnerabilities in malware. The normal antivirus is not
effective anymore against the new type of zero day attacks, and this new approach is
needed to detect the attacks. This new approach uses neural networks, and it uses S-Space
which helps calculate the similarities between malware. This S-Space enhances the
effectiveness of the classification process. Malware-SMELL works better than any other
method in both the traditional antivirus or any new zero day software detector in the
works. This Malware-SMELL identifies 80 to 97.69 percent of the attacks which is
higher than any other software out there. The document also looks at malware detection,
which includes hand crafted based techniques and deep learning techniques. The
researchers did present a step by step overview of the Malware-SMELL approach and
described the best approach.

Conclusion
  In summary,these research papers all collectively contribute to the discussion going on in
our world today which is how to strengthen our cybersecurity against attacks and unknown
threats. The unsupervised algorithms focus on the adaptability of technologies today, which
means that as technologies upgrade they can handle the evolving risk. The patch release offers
viewpoints that companies should release patches for software that impact our privacy and
confidentiality in a timely manner. The Malware-SMELL is a big ground breaking step in
identifying unknown vulnerabilities, which is better than traditional antivirus. As an aspiring
college student studying cybersecurity, this research provides an insight into what I should
expect. Incorporating this into the school academic, educating students in this will ensure that
people are more safe on how to protect themselves against these attacks and also ensure that
future cybersecurity personnel have the necessary knowledge for the future.
